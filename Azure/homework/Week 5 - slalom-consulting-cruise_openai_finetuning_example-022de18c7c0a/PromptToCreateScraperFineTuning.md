Create a Python script to scrape the FAQ questions and answers from the 'https://www.ncl.com/faq' webpage. The questions are in div elements with the class 'faq-question', and the answers are in div elements with the class 'faq-answer'. Use the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries for web scraping. Save the data in a JSON file, formatted for fine-tuning an OpenAI model. Each prompt should end with the separator '\n\n###\n\n', and each completion should start with a whitespace and end with the stop sequence '\n###\n'. Provide the code for this script
